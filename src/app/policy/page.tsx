          Seriously, worried about your data? Relax, champ! This is just a test.
          We don’t even have a server, and if you’re seeing this,
          congratulations: you’re running it locally—probably on a PC with more
          tabs open than a polar explorer. But fine, let’s pretend we’re super
          serious: &apos;We&apos;ll protect your data like it’s Fort Knox. We
          won’t sell it to Russian hackers, aliens, or even your nosy
          neighbor.&apos; Happy now? 😏
